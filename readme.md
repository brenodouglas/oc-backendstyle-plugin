# OctoberCMS Backend Style Changer

This is a very basic plugin which intended to add a changer to dashboard and change very basic backend styles with predefined one.

This is extremely useful when you want to provide your client to an option for change backend colors or small backend style changes.

Also you can create your own stylesheets and open Pull Request from [Plugin's Github Page](https://github.com/uxmsdevs/oc-backendstyle-plugin). You are always welcome..

v1.0.0 is shared with 6 different options.
